# Music Graph 🎵📈

**Music Graph** is a small package that lets you create musical strokes based on graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm!

## Installation 🛠️

To install **Music Graph**, simply run the following command in your terminal:

``sh
npx i music-graph
``

## Usage 🚀

Once installed, execute the `npm start` command in your terminal to open the interface.

For yes/no prompts, please enter `y` for yes and `n` for no.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Graph:** Start by creating a graph. Currently, only the `random graph` function is available.
2. **Enter Weights:** When prompted for weights, enter them separated by spaces (only numbers are accepted).
3. **Select Graphs & Find Shortest Path:** You can then select the graphs you have created and find the shortest path.

The available notes are:

``
do doS re reS mi fa faS sol solS la laS si
``

The path will be automatically copied to your clipboard once a route is found!

## Recommendations 🌟

We recommend installing [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and executing the `forMusescore.ahk` file. This way, by pressing `alt + m` within Musescore, you'll be able to input the notes smoothly and efficiently!
